# Smoke Vape Monitoring
### Overview
This prototype is design to monitor vape smoke
activitiy in the school campus. 

### Encounter supply problem
We use the 4 CHANNEL bi-directional level shifter
to handle the 5v components sensors MQ135.
Since, this ESP32 only operates 3.3v in order
to stablize the readings of the sensor.
